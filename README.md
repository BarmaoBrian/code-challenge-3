# Title
Movie Theater Ticketing

# Description
 * This Movie Theater web application allows users to purchase movie tickets from the theater.
 * Users can view movie details, such as the poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets.  *They can also select a movie from the menu and update the movie details accordingly.

# Project Setup

1. Create a new project folder on your local machine using the following steps ;
    To clone a repository to your local files, you can follow these steps:

    *Open your command-line interface.
    *Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. You can use the `cd` command to change directories.
    *Copy the repository's clone URL. You can find it on the GitHub repository page by clicking on the "Code" button and selecting the "Clone" option. Make sure to choose the HTTPS URL.
    *In the CLI, use the `git clone` command followed by the repository's clone URL.
    *Press Enter to execute the command. The repository will be cloned to your local machine.
    *After the cloning process completes,navigate into that directory using the `cd` command.

2. Make sure you have a local server running to serve the JSON data. 
3. Update the URLs in the `script.js` file to point to the correct endpoints on your local server.
4. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

# Core Deliverables

As user can;

1. See the first movie's details, including its poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets when the page loads.
2. See a menu of all movies on the left side of the page.
3. Buy a ticket for a movie, and the number of available tickets will decrease on the frontend.
